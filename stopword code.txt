Aim: write a program for Pre-Processing of text Document: stop word Removal a

Theory:-
The process of inverting data of something a computer can understand is refered to as Pre-Processing one of the major forms of Pare-processing is to filter out data useless in nature all language useless words (data) are to as stop word."

what are stop words? stop words:

A stop word is a Command, used word (such as "the" "a", "an", "in") that a search engine has been programmed to ignore both when engin retriving the as the result of a search query.

we would not want these words to take up space in our database or taking up valueable processing time for this one we Can remove then easily by storing a list of word that you consider to stop word. NITK (Natural language tool kit) in python has a list of stopword stored in 16 different languages you can find them in directory


from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
example_sent="we are the students of ckt college"
stop_words=set(stopwords.words('english'))
word_tokens=word_tokenize(example_sent)
filtered_sentence=[w for w in word_tokens if not w in stop_words]
filtered_sentence=[]
for w in word_tokens:
if w not in stop_words:
filtered_sentence.append(w)
print(word_tokens)
print(filtered_sentence)
